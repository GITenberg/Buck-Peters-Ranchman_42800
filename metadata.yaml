description: When Buck Peters went to Montana to start a new ranch, he found his partner
  dead, his cowhands being slaughtered like steers; himself shot full of holes, and
  a neighbor stealing his stock. All that could only mean one thing - a range war
  was imminent. Only Hopalong Cassidy could help Buck now - but he was in Texas with
  a new bride and a ranch to run. Hoppy had no choice. He was Buck's last hope. He
  had to come.
